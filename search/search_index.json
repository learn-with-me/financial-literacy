Bond performance is also closely tied to interest rates. For example, if you buy a bond with a 2% yield, it could become more valuable if interest rates drop, because newly issued bonds would have a lower yield than yours. On the other hand, higher interest rates could mean newly issued bonds have a higher yield than yours, lowering demand for your bond, and in turn, its value. To stimulate spending, the Federal Reserve typically cuts interest rates during economic downturns \u2014 periods that are usually worse for many stocks. But the lower interest rates will send the value of existing bonds higher, reinforcing the inverse price dynamic. 2022 wasn't your typical year. The Fed has been raising interest rates in an effort to tamp down rising inflation. And so far, both stocks and bonds are down more than 10%. Taxes Since stocks and bonds generate cash differently, they are taxed differently. Bond payments are usually subject to income tax, while profits from selling stocks are subject to capital gains tax (which is lower for some brackets). However, there are a couple of bond taxation loopholes investors should be aware of. Municipal bond payments are exempt from federal income tax. Most states also exempt their own municipal bonds (but not out-of-state municipal bonds) from state income taxes. Treasury bond payments are generally exempt from state income tax, although they are fully subject to federal income tax.

They are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. Earnings in a 529 plan grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board. Custodian The custodian, or account holder, is the person who opens the 529 plan and controls the money in the account. Often, it makes sense for the custodian to be the child\u2019s parent. If you make your child the account holder, the assets in the account will be more heavily factored into federal financial aid formulas. Hence your student may be awarded less financial aid. Due to changes to federal student aid forms beginning with the 2024 to 2025 academic year, students no longer have to report cash support on their FAFSA. This means distributions from a grandparent or other non-parent-relative\u2019s 529 plan will not impact financial aid. Beneficiary Child's name, who is going to benefit from the money in this account. If you have more than one child, you might want to set up separate accounts for each. Changing Beneficiary If the child decides not to go to college, you can preserve the tax benefits by changing the name of the beneficiary, which is allowed once per year. You can designate any other relative \u2014 a lucky niece or nephew, perhaps \u2014 or you might decide that you\u2019ve always wanted another degree. Non Qualified withdrawl In case you can't find anyone that can benefit from this money, you can still withdraw the money for any use, although you\u2019ll have to pay the applicable income tax as well as a 10 percent penalty on money the fund earned. The penalty is waived if the beneficiary attends an academy that\u2019s a branch of the U.S. service or gets a scholarship. On death If you were to die or become legally incapacitated, the successor account owner assumes all rights and responsibilities for the 529 account. The successor can be, but does not have to be, a spouse. It is important to pick a successor account owner who you can trust to fulfill your wishes. In case you do not assign a successor, in many (not all) 529 plans, the beneficiary (or the beneficiary\u2019s guardian if the beneficiary is still a minor) is named the account owner by default. Naming a successor account owner lets the 529 plan account transfer to the successor without having to go through probate, which can cause delays. The choice of successor owner can affect the financial aid treatment of the 529 plan. If the successor is the student or spouse, it will be treated more favorably than if the successor is someone else. References What Is a 529 Plan?

These are the ones that tell you that they'll manage your money for you (say, at a fee of 1.5% per year, of money invested). What they are really saying is: 1. Let's build a financial plan together and agree upon it 2. You won't have to deal with managing money on a daily basis. We'll do it for you. 3. We won't guarantee a return, since we're working on a plan that you asked us to work on. We're simply managing the money and the plan you gave us (even if we recommended the plan to you). These are mostly least helpful for growth. Especially because they won't guarantee growth. They won't take responsibility for the return. They're simply working for you and your money, and offloading you from having to manage your money. Some people may argue they're helpful, which may be true. In my opinion, they may be helpful for people who have no time to do anything with their money, have at least a decade long time horizon and don't care for the rate the money grows, as long as it doesn't lose value. Think of these like hired help, just like you'd hire someone to clean your home because you don't want to or don't have time for.

Changing health plan You can anytime change your health plan during open enrollment or a qualified life event, even when you own a HSA account. You just won't be able to contribute more to the HSA account anymore. Contribution limit For 2022, if you have an HDHP, you can contribute up to $3,650 for self-only coverage and up to $7,300 for family coverage into an HSA.

There are companies that let's you invest your HSA contributions into money market to get higher returns as well.

Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc are all different types of securities. Also, your assets like home, car, gold, etc cannot be classified as a security. Equity securities generally refer to stocks. Debt securities , also called fixed-income securities, generally refer to bonds. Types of Securities Stock Stocks represent partial ownership (or equity ) in a company. When you buy stock, you\u2019re actually purchasing a tiny slice of the company \u2014 one or more \"shares\". You buy a share because you believe that the company's value will go over time, and so will your investment in it's shares. Performance of such investment is directly tied to the valuation of the company. Stocks are also known as corporate stock, common stock, corporate shares, equity shares and equity securities. Companies may issue shares to the public for several reasons, but the most common is to raise cash that can be used to fuel future growth. Bonds Bonds are a loan from you to a company or government. There\u2019s no equity involved, nor any shares to buy. Put simply, a company or government is in debt to you when you buy a bond, and it will pay you interest on the loan for a set period, after which it will pay back the full amount you bought the bond for. But bonds aren\u2019t completely risk-free. If the company goes bankrupt during the bond period, you\u2019ll stop receiving interest payments and may not get back your full principal. With bonds, you usually know exactly what you\u2019re signing up for, and the regular interest payments can be used as a source of predictable fixed income over long periods. The durations of bonds depend on the type you buy, but commonly range from a few days to 30 years. Likewise, the interest rate \u2014 known as yield \u2014 will vary depending on the type and duration of the bond. Bonds generate cash through regular interest payments. The distribution frequency can vary, but it\u2019s generally as follows: Treasury bonds and notes: Every six months until maturity. Treasury bills: Only upon maturity. Corporate bonds: Semiannually, quarterly, monthly or at maturity. Mutual Funds Mutual funds let you pool your money with other investors to \"mutually\" buy stocks, bonds, and other investments. They're run by professional money managers who decide which securities to buy (stocks, bonds, etc.) and when to sell them. You get exposure to all the investments in the fund and any income they generate. ETFs Like mutual funds, Exchange-Traded Funds offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that investment pool. Unlike mutual funds, however, ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) of the shares, that is, the value of the ETF\u2019s assets minus its liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Security Broker You can't just walk to a company and ask for a share in exchange for money. And you can't either loan them money in exchange for interest over time. Financial institutions have established a system to handle these transactions, and they are done through an entity called a broker. There are a variety of types of brokerages, that lets you purchase a variety of investment options, however they vary in the way you can use them. A Standard Brokerage has access to a variety of investments option to purchase, with no limits on the purchase. Individual Retirement Account (IRA) are also a type of brokerage that lets you purchase a variety of investment options, however the funds managed by these brokerages grow in a tax-advanted account that can be used in retirement. 529 Education Savings is another brokerage that lets you purchase a variety of investment options, however the funds managed (being tax-advantaged) can only be used for educational purposes. Section 529 plans are tax-qualified college saving or prepaid tuition programs generally offered and administered by the states. Created as tax-advantaged savings vehicles, they were designed to encourage families to save for future college education expenses. At some point, only standard brokerages existed. The government enabled brokerages like IRA, 529, and HSA to encourage people to save and grow their money either tax-free or tax-deferred way, but for critical purposes like retirement, education and health. History In 1602 , the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (now Euronext Amsterdam) became the first official stock market with trading in shares of the Dutch East India Company, the first company to issue stock. On May 17, 1792 , the New York Stock Exchange opened under a platanus occidentalis (buttonwood tree) in New York City, as 24 stockbrokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement, agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree. IRAs were started in the year 1974 . The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) created individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Congress designed traditional IRAs originally to have two roles: first, to give individuals not covered by retirement plans at work a tax-advantaged savings plan, and second, to play a complementary role to the employer-sponsored retirement system by preserving rollover assets at job change or retirement. The first prepaid college savings vehicle was created in 1986 by the state of Michigan. In 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the income from the plan should not be subject to the federal income tax. HSAs were established as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which included the enactment of Internal Revenue Code section 223, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2003 , signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003.

Summary For storing money, find a good online-only bank to get the best interest rates on savings account, CDs, and other financial products. Before getting a loan from a bank, check local credit unions as well, as they may offer lower interest rates. Investment in securities require you to have a brokerage account. Find a good broker that suits your needs. Types of Institutions Retail Bank A retail bank is where you most often do your everyday banking, like withdrawing cash or depositing a check. Retail banks offer a range of products and services, such as savings accounts, checking accounts, personal loans, debit cards, credit cards or home mortgages, that are geared toward the individual consumer (it's also called consumer banking). Commercial Bank A retail bank is typically part of a larger commercial bank, which provides the services like (loans, credit cards, mortgages, checking and savings accounts, etc.) to both individuals and businesses. Commercial banks generally make their money by taking the deposits they receive from their customers and using those assets to lend money with interest to other individuals or businesses. Many commercial banks also have an investment banking arm that specializes in products and services for large investors and corporate customers, such as advising on mergers and acquisitions, and trading securities. Credit Union Credit unions provide a lot of the same products and services that retail banks do; the major difference is that they are not-for-profit , cooperative financial institutions whose purpose is to benefit their members. Consumers might find that credit unions offer financial products or services with more favorable terms than those offered by large commercial banks. That\u2019s because profits may be returned to members in the form of better account terms, lower interest rates, fewer fees or additional services. Brokerage Firm A brokerage firm, or simply a brokerage, facilitates transactions involving the trade of securities. At most brokerages, stockbrokers serve investors who trade public stocks or bonds, or want to invest in different types of funds. A full-service brokerage provides a variety of services other than just trading. These might include market analysis and research, tax advice or retirement and estate planning. Since full-service brokerages provide a large number of services, they often charge investors higher fees or commissions than discount brokerages , which only execute trades without offering additional financial services. Pros and Cons Bank vs Credit Unions Credit Unions are not safer than Banks. Accounts in banks and credit unions are both insured for amounts up to $250,000 via either the FDIC for banks or the NCUA for credit unions. If you have more than $250,000 to deposit at either a bank or credit union, you should speak to account managers. Most credit unions cannot compete with banks when it comes to convenience (access to ATMs and branches) and technology like mobile banking. Many credit unions also have little to offer when it comes to online banking. Credit unions may offer lower interest rates on loans , but the array of financial products may be limited in scope compared with big banks. You might have to live or work in a certain region to become a member of a credit union. Or the field of membership, which is the common bond shared by the credit union members, might have other requirements. Brokerage vs Bank Brokerage accounts have features that are similar to a bank account\u2014you can deposit and withdraw money when you wish, use checks, debit cards, and make automatic payments. However, there are a couple major differences between them. Brokerage account gives you the ability to buy and sell securities (e.g., mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, bonds, etc.) to help grow your money, while a bank account typically helps you manage your cash through a savings or checking account. Brokerage accounts are also not FDIC Insured, while bank balances are (up to $250K per depositor). The insurance you get for a brokerage account only protects you against brokerage failure ( SIPC ). Taxation Taxable account An account that you fund with post-tax dollars. If you earned money on your investment at the time that you sold it, you may have to pay capital gains tax on those earnings. If you lost money, then you may be able to get a tax deduction by reporting a capital loss. Tax-advantaged account A tax-advantaged account helps reduce your tax burden either by: Deferring the taxes on your contributions and investment growth until you make withdrawals in the future. Or by allowing for tax-free growth on your post-tax contributions, so you likely won\u2019t end up owing taxes when you make withdrawals down the line. Tax-advantaged accounts are commonly used to save for retirement, health or education and can include Roth and Traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, HSA, 529 accounts.
